# VNEX
- A Discord bot infrastructure made purely in discord.js.

  - Supports Context Commands and Modals.
  - Completely modular, everything is kept in their own seperate files.
  - Keeps logs of all of the chats in all joined servers.
  - Has cool looking outputs.

- How to use
  - Create a Discord bot from [The Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.dev).
  - Put the bot's token and bot's client ID in a file called "config.json" in the main directory with the following syntax:
  ```json
  {
    "token":"bots-token-here",
    "clientId":"bots-clientID-here"
  } 
  ```
